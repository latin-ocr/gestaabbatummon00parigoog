ιιιιιοιιοιιιιοι. xix

The story is cedainly told with more animation, andin
mester detail, than we osten find in the narratives of
monastic writers ; hut its Latin is anything but elegant,
or even correct, und at times, as elsewhere in the Second
Section, the writer's meaning is involved in obscurity.
In style and Latinity the language of this Section is
probably much on a par with the fragment of the (lectu
Edrvardi Primi, acknowledged by Rishangcr aa 1hia
own, to which allusion has previously been made.
