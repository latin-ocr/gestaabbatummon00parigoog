On the aoth ef J anuary 1857, tho Master of the Rolls
submitted to the lhcasury a proposal for the publication
of materiale for the History of this Country from the
invasion of the Romans te the Reign of Hemy VIII.

'l'he Mastcr of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference te periodical er chronological
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materiale ·
as were most scarce and veluable.

He proposed that each chronicis or historical docu-
ment to bc edited should be treated in tho same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps ; and
for this purpose the most* correct text should bc formed
hom an accurate collation of the best MSS.

'lo render the work more generally useful, the Master
oi the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times ol' the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no
other notc or comment was to be allowed, except what
might be necessary to establish the correctness of the

text.
